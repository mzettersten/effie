X,effie_004,L2_8,Tintera,JS,10/24/19,NA,M,NA,8.5,-14,1,White,No,Y,Y,"starting coding a little late in the second to last trial, he was doing really short looks. Pretty good; a little wiggly. "

Got a little sleepy during the second to last trial; mom (watching from outside booth) indicated that baby may be babbling at certain points during experiment.

X,effie_013,L1_2,Tintera,HW,11/5/19,NA,M,NA,8.8,-6,1,"American Indian or Alaska Native, White",No,Y,N,"Baby was attentive, but experimenter accidentally advanced past familiarization headturn training directly to test (and experiment therefore seemed to quit early - baby was hearing test items together with familiarization)"
X,effie_014,L1_8,Tintera,JS/LF,11/7/19,NA,M,NA,6.9,-2,1,White,No,Y,Y,Pretty squirmy and kept on looking back at dad. Should have held the 6 key down for a little longer during trial 4.

X,effie_017,L1_2,Tintera,EK,11/12/19,NA,M,NA,6,-8,1,White,No,Y,Y,Good! Looked at mom a few time in the beginning but was good during the testing/trials
X,effie_018,L1_8,Tintera,JS,11/13/19,NA,F,NA,8.1,-1,1,White,No,Y,Y,really great! Intital exposure audio started ~ 500 ms in (12/4 MZ)
X,effie_019,L1_2,Tintera,JS,11/14/19,NA,M,NA,6.6,6,1,White,No,Y,Y,really great! Heard wrong audio filed - changed to the correct one they he heard (12/2 EK); initial exposure audio started ~500 ms in (12/4 MZ)
X,effie_020,L1_2,Tintera,JS,11/15/19,NA,F,NA,8.7,-1,1,Other,No,N,Y,good! Long looking times. A little fussy during the last two trials. Heard wrong audio file - changed to the one she heard (12/2 EK); Intital exposure audio started ~ 500 ms in (12/4 MZ)
X,effie_021,L1_2,Tintera,JS,11/18/19,NA,F,NA,7.3,4,1,White,No,Y,Y,a little squirmy and kept looking back at mom. During the training phase (cloud video) she didn't watch the cloud video for 3/4 of it. Otherwise good
X,effie_022,L1_8,Tintera,AM,11/19/19,NA,M,NA,7.9,-1,1,White,No,Y,N,"Not super attentive during first half of the testing trials, and then turned around for long period of time to face mom during trial 6. Turned back around and completed a few more trials, but then faced momfor a long time again. Wasn't super attentive to begin with, and mom said he missed a nap, so I just ended it early. "
X,effie_023,L2_2,Tintera,AM,11/19/19,NA,F,NA,6.5,8,1,Other,No,Y,Y,Good! A little distracted before the last two trials but made it through.
X,effie_024,L2_8,Tintera,EK,11/19/19,NA,M,NA,7.9,-2,1,White,No,Y,Y,good! A little squirmy but not bad. Took my finger off too early briefy during the testing phase and started Kino after 15 sec.  Hard to tell a few times if he was still look as he turned back toward mom and covered he face with his arms briefly 
X,effie_025,L1_2,Tintera,JS,11/20/19,NA,F,NA,7.4,-11,1,White,No,Y,N,"Not very attentive during the pre-exposure phase. During the headturn practice, she never turned her head to look at the spinners. She was playing with mom's hairtie. Once we moved onto the test phase, the spinner was on the right side and she never looked. During all of the study, she was playing with mom's hairtie. I skipped to the next trial so the spinner would plan on the left screen, and she turned her head to look. But when the spinner went to the right screen, she never looked. I ended the study at trial 10 because the baby was just sitting in silence and playing with the hairtie. Also, something happened with Kino, and it only recorded for 1 second, so there's no video :(. I think it was because there were two kino window open. Video missing/ incorrect video portion exported (12/4 MZ)"
X,effie_026,L1_8,Tintera,LF,11/21/19,NA,F,NA,8.4,-2,1,White,No,Y,Y,great!

X,effie_029,L1_2,Tintera,DB,11/23/19,NA,F,NA,7.9,-7,1,White,No,Y,N,"Distracted by shoes, pants, etc and fussed out with a few trials to go"
X,effie_030,L1_8,Gimli,JS,11/25/19,NA,F,NA,8.6,3,1,"White, Black or African American",No,Y,N,"Super squirmy and not paying attention. I stopped after 2 test trials.Audio started about 500 ms in (12/4 MZ). (I think the booth was Tintera. I set up Gimli because Tintera wasn't working, but then got it to work - JS)"
X,effie_031,L2_2,Tintera,EK,11/25/19,NA,F,NA,6.7,-5,1,White,No,Y,Y,VERY squirmy. Mom had to turn her around several times. Not very long looks. Video record started few second late - on third word (EK 12/11/19)

X,effie_033,L1_2,Tintera,LF,12/5/19,NA,F,NA,6.6,-2,1,White,No,Y,Y,"good, lots of quick looks but good"
X,effie_034,L1_8,Tintera,JS,12/5/19,NA,F,NA,6.4,3,1,White,Yes,Y,Y?,"baby was slowly sliding down mom's lap throughout the study. I feel like this might have affected the angle in which she saw the side screens. Because she was half laying down, she was looking up to see the sidescreens. "
X,effie_035,L2_2,Tintera,JS,12/6/19,NA,M,NA,6.2,-4,1,White,No,Y,Y,"Good. Long looks. Mom looked to the side screens a few times. During familiarization, he only looked at one spinner the whole time. He didn't stop looking, so it never advanced to the next spinner. "
X,effie_036,L2_8,Tintera,JS,12/6/19,NA,M,NA,8.8,4,1,White,No,Y,Y,"Good. Short looks. Looked back at mom a handful of times towards the end. The audio started ~3 seconds before the cloud video because when I clicked the audio, the window popped up in a weird location, and I cuoldn't see where on the desktop it was. "
x,effie_037,L1_2,Tintera,JS,12/10/19,NA,F,NA,6.3,9,1,White,No,Y,Y,"Good. Looking time got shorter throughoug the study. She was getting a little sleepy towards the end, mom said she's usually asleep at this time. "

x,effie_039,L2_2,Tintera,DB,12/12/19,NA,M,NA,6.1,-19,1,White,No,Y,Y,"Good, lots of quick look aways; only looked to one side during familiarization, seemed to favor that side during test? "

x,effie_041,L1_2,Tintera,JS,12/13/19,NA,M,NA,6.5,-20,1,White,No,Y,Y,Good! Short looks. MZ: appears that effie_040 was used as subjCode in data
x,effie_042,L1_8,Tintera,JS,12/20/19,NA,F,NA,8.5,-7,1,White,No,Y,Y,"Good. Around trial 5, she started waving her hand and would look at the spinner and then look down at her hand and then back up, so it was a little tricky to code. From trial 5 to the end, she was waving her hand around a lot. "
x,effie_043,L2_2,Tintera,JS,1/6/20,NA,F,NA,6.5,2,1,White,No,N,Y,Good! Slid down mom's lap a little so she was looking up towards the side screens. Good looking time. 
x,effie_044,L2_8,Tintera,JS,1/8/20,NA,M,NA,6.5,-8,1,White,No,Y,Y,"Good! It seems like he consistently looked at the right side spinner longer each time. He would look at the spinner, look down, and then look at the spinner again a lot. He was chewing on his fingers during most of the study, but seemed pretty attentive. "
x,effie_045,L1_2,Tintera,JS,1/8/20,NA,F,NA,8.3,0,1,White,No,Y,Y,Great! 
x,effie_046,L1_8,Tintera,JS,1/29/20,NA,M,NA,7.1,-7,1,White,No,Y,Y,"VERY squirmy. Long looks, but still squirmy. Was playing with the drawstring on dad's hoodie during parts of the study. During familiarization, he only looked at the right spinner. Worth rewatching the videos to see which trials he was fussy. "

x,effie_051,L2_2,Tintera,HW,2/11/20,NA,M,NA,7.7,3,1,White,No,Y,Y,was very squirmy! In Trial 1 I believe I pressed 4 before his head was turned. He was kind of difficult to online code because he would shift his eyes upwards. I only coded a side look when both his head was turned and his eyes were at screen level

Still did great throughout!; MZ note: given that this results in a 25s delay between training and test, I decided to exclude this infant due to experimenter error"
x,effie_059,L2_2,Tintera,JS,3/4/20,NA,F,NA,8.2,-7,1,White,No,Y,N,too squirmy. Baby got really squirmy around trial 9 and lost interest in the study. I had to skip a trial (I think trial 5) because she wasn't looking at the spinner. I stopped with 3 trials reminaing because she was too squirmy.
